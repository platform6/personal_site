  
I made a resolution on January 6, 2025 to try to, “Spend a proportional amount of time playing games as making games.” during the year.

I used an app to track what I was doing when I had a stretch of time that I expected to exceed 15 minutes where I could concentrate on one of my hobbies. 

I appreciate my past self’s wording of the resolution.  10ish percent of all hobby time was spent on game development. Which technically, a thousand percent fits the definition of a proportion (a part, share, or number considered in comparative relation to a whole.)  It’s definitely a number, and has a relation to a whole.  No doubt.  Obviously, not to lie to you or myself. The idea was to make it 50/50.  

The interesting thing was just recognizing when I had time where I could concentrate on a hobby.  Most of this time was recorded on a bus commuting back and forth to Boston. 

It is difficult to want to whip out a laptop and do game development, after a full day in front of another laptop doing other types of development.  What is easy, and can keep your brain from shrieking, is playing around, making a little guy jump, or make a choice to inflate big number go up up up. 

About 100 hours, or 4 days were spent on game dev, art, or otherwise other creative pursuits.  Honestly, it’s less but it’s a 100 hours I hadn’t spent before. 

I can look at these numbers and feel guilty that I’ve spent about 20 days this past year playing video games.  20 days \- that’s a lot\!  But, I really don’t, it’s what I enjoy doing.  There is no shame in a hobby \- and no shame in a hobby you can do in your bus dungeon.
