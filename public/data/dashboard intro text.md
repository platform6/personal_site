### Why all this then?

I made a resolution on January 6, 2025 to try to, "Spend a proportional amount of time playing games as making games." during the year. Although that resolution is a bit awkwardly phrased on second glance, I appreciate my past self’s wording.

Ten-ish percent of all hobby time was spent on game development. Which technically, a thousand percent, fits the definition of a proportion (a part, share, or number considered in comparative relation to a whole.) It’s definitely a number, and has a relation to a whole. No doubt. Obviously, not to lie to you, or myself.

The idea was to make it 50/50.

### Where did all the numbers come from?

I used an app to track what I was doing when I had a stretch of time that I expected to exceed 15 minutes. This was time I expected myself to concentrate fully on one of these categories, so time playing a game with family - or futzing on a phone game were not included.

When I made the resolution it seemed pretty rare that I had a solid chunk of uninterupted time with work, family, and other general life tasks. But, It was an unknown - the exact amount of time I was spending on what task. It doesn't really matter ultimatley. A lot of my time is spent doing the things I have the spark/motivation to do at that momemnt. This was an effort to avoid saying, "I am tired, I'm not going to do that" and move to just doing it while I am tired or when the spark to do it was missing.

### Was the experiment a sucess?

Most of this time was recorded on a bus commuting back and forth to Boston. This is my main time now that I have to spend as I wish. However, there is some complications that arise from this - the bus is shaky, it can be cramped. I don't know exactly how much was bus dungeon time, as I didn't think to add a 'commuting' tag or anything like that. I will consider it for the new year.

It is difficult to want to whip out a laptop and do game development. Especially after a full day in front of another laptop doing other types of development. Development is kind of weird word, in that it doesn't really express what a person is actually doing. When someone walks into a room, hardly ever does someone say, "I'm developing." What it really is, is facing a tidal wave of unknowns, doubting your ability to tackle even the smallest solution, and proceeding anyway. That's what I think, at least. Tidal wave battle - just isn't easily dealt with on a bus.

What is easy, and can keep your brain from shrieking, is playing around, making a little guy jump, or make a choice to inflate big number go up up up.

About 100 hours this year, or 4 days were spent on game dev, art, or otherwise other creative pursuits. Honestly, it’s less than maybe I was hoping for, but it’s a 100 hours I hadn’t spent before.

### What's next?

I can look at these numbers and feel guilty that I’ve spent about 20 days this past year playing video games. 20 days - that’s a lot! But, I really don’t, it’s what I enjoy doing. There is no shame in a hobby - and no shame in a hobby you can do in your bus dungeon. Being the age that I am, more time is behind me than lay ahead. That's just the math of middle age. So, while I'll continue to track these numbers in 2026. I am going to add a 'Walking' category with the hope that the time ahead just may move an inch or two toward equalling the time behind.
