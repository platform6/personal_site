### Why all this then?

I made a resolution back on January 6, 2025 to try to, "Spend a proportional amount of time playing games as making games" during the year. Although that resolution is awkwardly phrased on second glance, I appreciate my past self’s wording.

Ten or so percent of all hobby time was spent on game development. Which technically, a thousand percent, fits the definition of a proportion. It’s definitely a number and has a relation to a whole. No doubt. Obviously, not to lie to you, or myself.

The idea was to make it 50/50.

### Where did all the numbers come from?

I used an app to track what I was doing when I had a stretch of time that I expected to exceed 15 minutes. I then imported that in into a Supabase database table to get it to look nice and appear here.

The general rule I followed was to start the timer when I expected myself to concentrate fully on one of these categories, so time playing a game with family - or futzing on my phone (game or not) were not included.

At the start it seemed pretty rare that I had a solid chunk of uninterupted time with work, family, and other general life tasks. Tracking all this gives me an idea of the actual time I have on my hands. It was fun putting this all together. So now I know I have about 40 hours a month at my disposal - doesn't seem like a lot.

### The Cold Hard Eye of Retrospect

Most of this time was tracked while on a bus commuting back and forth to Boston. This is my main time now that I have to spend as I wish. However, there is some complications that arise from this - the bus is shaky, it can be cramped. I don't know exactly how much was bus dungeon time, as I didn't think to add a 'commuting' tag or anything like that. I will consider that for the new year.

It is difficult to want to whip out a laptop and do game development. Especially after a full day in front of another laptop doing other types of development. Development is kind of weird word, in that it doesn't really express what a person is actually doing. When someone walks into a room, hardly ever does someone say, "I'm developing." What it really is, is facing a some unknown technical thing, doubting your ability to tackle even the smallest solution, and proceeding to clack away on a keyboard to try to make the computer do something anyway. A bit of a tidal wave battle - just isn't easily dealt with on a bus.

What is crazy is the moment you think about making a game it fractals out to all these other disiplines - code, music, art, mechanics. It's just a terribley difficult thing to do - especially when you have the option of just playing a game that someone already did that part.

What is easy, and can keep your brain from shrieking, is playing around, making a little guy jump, or make a choice to inflate big number go up up up.

Around 100 hours this year, or 4 days were spent on game dev, art, or otherwise other creative pursuits. Honestly, it’s less than I was hoping for, but it’s a 100 hours I hadn’t spent before.

So, I didn't really hit the goal - but I'm glad at least I had a reminder throughout the year to mix up my focus.

### To The New Year

I can look at these numbers and feel guilty that I’ve spent about 20 days this past year playing video games. 20 days - that’s a lot! But, I really don’t, it’s what I enjoy doing. If it was reading a book - I bet you'd be fine with it.

There is no shame in a hobby - and no shame in a hobby you can do on a commute. I'll refine the goal this year. Playing games 50% - everything else should sum up to 50%. I'm going to throw in a "Movement" category to try to remain an ambulatory human being for as long as I can. Witcher 4 isn't going to play itself.
