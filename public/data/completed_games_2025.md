## 1000xResist

Time wise, I finished this game a year ago as of this writing.  Memory is a funny thing, in that I think about the story quite frequently but sitting here I don’t really remember the details - like this happened first and then this.  My brain does not struggle to conjure the feeling of this game though.  I think about certain plot events frequently and feel like this game entangles itself so much with the sweeping essence of being a counscious thing with a past and a family and a uncertain future.

To jog my memory I looked up a walkthrough on YouTube just now. At random, hitting a piece of dialog.  “What’s fair and what’s true - what’s more important?”  This give the sense at what the story is trying to get at.  Over and over it’s got absolute banger lines like this.  

The moment in the game where the main character is talking to their mom in the stairwell really got me.

## Florence

The scene that sticks with me is where two characters are having a conversation. An obscured conversation where you can't really tell what they are saying - but get the gist of it by their facial expressions and tone. You try to fit in puzzle pieces to complete the main characters dialog - and this mechanic really gets to the multiple things you're trying to do when you talk to someone. You want to make your point - you want to complete the puzzle, but you also want to do it before the buzzer runs out. The story of this is of a relationship that comes together and falls apart and it tells that really quick and doesn't overstay its welcome.

## If On A Winter's Night Four Travelers

It's got a train. It's got strangers. What else do you have to say? The four strangers have lives that are just absolutely falling apart and the isometric viewpoint conveys these disasters are your little toys to explore. This is a game I had to look up a guide too since it has that type of puzzle solving where you have to try things over and over again in a way that I find annoying. The music and atmosphere is very on point, and the story has some real grim things going on - which is a thumbs up in my book.

## Metaphor Refantazio

In 2024 I played Persona 5: Royal. Started in the fall and finished around Christmas time. It was on of my top 20 all timers but, it was one of those 100+ RPG's that just devour time units. To myself I said, "I'll need a break from this type of game for a while" I then promptly started Metaphor Refantazio a month later.

This would be a four month project to complete. The trick of these games is that they have to be over 100 hours, you have to hang out with the characters, and it has to become a place that you visit - more than a game you play. Metaphor was able to play the same trick on my brain again.

I enjoyed hanging out with my buddies, and battling ice dragons. While it lacks somethings that I enjoyed in Persona it still delivered on the whole "power of friendship" motif these games are going for.

It did drag a little at the end and the way that saves works really messed me up right at the end. Where I had to lower the difficulty to easy to get out of a weird save state. That's really on me though - Never leave the dungeon for last.

## Sackboy: A Big Adventure

This was the first game Rosie actively wanted to play with me. "Can we play Sackboy?" was very fun to hear repeatedly. People would come over and she would want to show people Sackboy. Many guests sat through her explaining how Sackboy worked, and I was very proud of how excited she was to discover it. During the span of us playing it, she moved from never having played a game to being able to make Sackboy move and jump.

She got to the point where she learned enough, that she got frustrated when things didn't go her way. Frustrated might be putting it mildly. She flat out got pissed sometimes. Hopefully, I did a good job in convincing her to try again even after Sackboy falls into a pit of spikes. In real life too, I would invoke Sackboy when she took a spill or dropped something. "What does Sackboy do?" "Try again"

We rolled credits on this on her fourth birthday. I'll always like this game because of that.

## Hauntii

It's crazy to me that this is a game that most people won't play. This is a game that has a great art style and great music. The music is clearly made by professional musicians. The gameplay is very well though out and the theme is unique and worthwhile.

## Clair Obscure: Expedition 33

The best trick this game pulls it telling a story that you can care about. The opening gets its hooks into you quick and then doubles down on it. There is a tipping point - then a tripling down. Although, as I look back at it - the story can kind of breakdown with time.

As a tangent. I remember seeing this game in showcases like a year ago and calling that it was going to be good. I will say one of the interesting things about following games is that you can see a preview and four years later be able to see if you were right about your instincts or not.

I called this only in my mind and have no proof to show you of my prescience. I did the same for Helldivers 2 - I knew it would blow up. While these two games are not often spoken of in the same context. I think what they share is that they both have a perspective.

Convention would tell you to have a hero. Expedition 33 has a whole bunch of them - Helldivers has a nameless replaceable one. The hero stands as a part of the whole.

You got to have a weird little guy. Expedition 33 has a weird balloon guy.

## South of Midnight

Similar to Hauntii, this games proves you can do everything right and still maybe not break containment or hit a grand slam in the "Video Game" world. I was excited when this game was revealed in a showcase. I will say one of the interesting things about following games is that you can see a preview and four years later be able to see if you were right about your instincts or not.

## Bramble: The Mountain King

I have been a big fan in what I suppose people call "folk horror." It's a genre I can't really define but seems to pop up regarding things that I like. Witcher 3 is a folk horror game, I think. Midsommar, a folk horror movie, and Bramble a "folk horror" fairy tale.

What is folk horror - I guess it boils down to weird stuff that happens in the woods. While I live near woods - I don't normally go into the woods. However, I have been "lost" in the woods exactly once and it was terrifying. The woods are bad, no denying and weird stuff happening in them - that' s the worse.

## Monster Train II

As someone who has often daydreamed of writing the script for "Gremlins 3", how could I not play a game named Monster Train II. Here's the deal - with this type of game it's always difficult to say when you have "completed" it. I define one successful run as complete. You don't always get credits on that successful run so that is debatable. I'm not one to grind out completing a run with all the factions. I'm not gonna sit here and play the candlesticks when I feel like I got the same experience from the fire demons and blue angels. You know exactly what I mean.

## Chrono Trigger

Ok, this is complicated one. This game sits among the pantheon of games that are mentioned with reverence and awe by the various gamine podcasts I listen to. I copy/paste here my most frustrated text sent to Dave, the biggest Chrono Trigger fan that I know.

"I  think I'm all set with Chrono Trigger.  The final boss is badly designed and not fun.  You know those lengthy side quests you did to get the armor that prevents status effects - fuck you, they don't work here for no discernable reason.  Oh you have a healer that does group HP revive - well, that robot has stop on it 80% of the time now.  Oh, would you like a turn? Nah.  Ok, so after a 1/2 hour I'll swat you and kill you in one hit. Isn't this a fun game, that feels worth it?  No.  I legit got in an loop for 15 minutes where he would do a fire attack, heal Robo because he was wearing Red Plate, cast confuse - and my turn gets skipped. Over and over. I can't revive Lucca or Chrono because as soon as I do they're instantly dead. I like hard bosses - but that's just bad turn based design.  The game has some really charming characters and the art and music are top notch. The story was good and it holds up after 30 years.  But, they waste your time.  Don't have a final boss that takes a 1/2 hour for a phase 1 and then just party wipe me because? because why? I hadn't even had a turn yet after phase 1."

That being said - from a historical perspective it's a very good game. You can see the roots of a lot of modern game design from this game that came out almost 31 years ago. I appreciate it a lot. To be honest, this was a "eat your broccoli" playthrough, in that there is a long term benefit from me having played through it. However, I usually like my broccoli smushed up with ice cream and cookies. Not steamed, with totally BS final bosses.

I did beat that final boss by the way. I devoured my broccoli.

## A Short Hike

It was mid way through the year and I noticed my list of completed games was quite sparse so packed in some smaller games I had always been meaning to play. A Short Hike is kind of the quintessential "short" game in that it's easily beaten under 10 hours. It's a breezy thing, where you can jump off of cliffs and swoop around as a little bird. The puzzles are intuitive and the hook of climbing a mountain just works the way it is supposed to.

## Thirty Flights Of Loving

This is another of the short games whose titles I've always bumped into.

## Hollow Knight: Silksong

This is the big one. A lot of what spurred me on to keep writing these year end blurbs about the games I've finished was this game. This is an instance where personal events in life intersected with the game I was playing in a way to make the parts greater than the whole.

There is no easy way to get into how this game struck to the core of an emotion that I didn't know I needed to feel without mentioning the passing of my puppy, Mulder. In the fall we had to put him down after a decade with us due to a leaky heart valve. Mulder was the dog that Liz and I got when we were still in an apartment. He was there when my Dad died and when his kitty sister Cheryl died. He was there when Rosie was born and when we moved houses. He was just there for everything that made up what I would call, my true adult life. He was a Beagle, and there is an unmentioned kinship I feel with anyone that I meet that is a beagle owner. As the secret that none of us really want to talk about, as it makes us sound like horrible people is that beagles are kind of assholes. But, the kind of adorable asshole you can not help but love. When we drove the vet with him and drove home without him, there was a part of me that knew I really wasn't processing the whole thing. It had been placed in the iron cube of things that you just don't really want to directly face. As much as I try to get things out of this cube to shine the light on them to disinfect, as I know that is the healthier option, cube imprisonment does no favors to me or the cube spirits. As much as I try - things still end up there.

I was excited when this came out, I loved Hollow Knight. It is a super challenging game that I played when I needed regimented scheduled friction to feel the feelings of moving to a new house. Feeling overwhelmed - how can I pay for it? What if it's terrible? Was this the right choice? It was helpful to know I had Hollow Knight

There is nothing like the feeling of exploring in this type of game, venturing out from your bench to head face first into terrible monsters and sharp spikes. As you press on you feel the distance from yourself and the last save spot intensely which give the first bench you rest at a special importance.
